== How to run a playbook ==

In general to run any ansible playbook you will want to run:

ansible-playbook site.yml

== Idempotency ==

All playbooks should be idempotent. Ie, if run once they should bring the 
machine(s) to the desired state, and if run again N times after that they should
make 0 changes (because the machine(s) are in the desired state). 
Please make sure your playbooks are idempotent.
