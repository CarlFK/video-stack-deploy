== setup and testing the setup ==

There are a few setup workflows that try to share common files.
there are different preseed and late_comand.sh files for
Debian/Ubuntu and usb/pxe.
they are all very similar, maybe they can be merged later.

1. clone repo to your local machine.
2. edit inventory/hosts
3. decide where the files will be hosted.
Choices:
a. local machine using http server
b. some other machine using http, either local or the cloud
c. copy to usb stick (only makes sense for usb stick install)
d. copy to pxe server (only make sense for pxe installs)

4. Debian Stretch or Ubuntu LTS.

5. Make a usb stick
Even if you are going to do pxe installs, you need to build the pxe server.

6. Boot a target machine from usb stick.
The installer will ask for a hostname.

That will install OS and run ansible for that $hostname.
Result is a machine ready to be used in production.
