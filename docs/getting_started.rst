Getting Started
===============

Welcome to the DebConf videoteam Ansible documentation. The goal of this
website is to step you through using our Ansible configuration in a conference
setting. The Ansible roles are stored in a git repository on `Salsa`_.

If you are part of Debian and plan to organise an event you intent to record,
please `contact us`_! Maybe a member of our team can attend it and help you with
your setup. If not, we can certainly give you some advice or perhaps lend you
some hardware.

Please check out our `general documentation`_ for information about what
hardware and software we use as well as how we set that up. This guide is
designed to show you how to use our Ansible setup within that general context.
