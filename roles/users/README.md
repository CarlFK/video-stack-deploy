To add new keys to the user's ~/.ssh/authorized_keys, simply add them to
the "files/public_keys" directory.

If you need it on all on site machines (video mixer, local icecast, etc.), put
it in "files/public_keys/onsite".

If you need it on all on site machines (machines not on the conference venue),
put it in "files/public_keys/offsite".

For clarity's sake, please name that file $your_name.pub
