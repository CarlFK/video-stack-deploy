  <p>Hello, I'm {{ inventory_hostname }}, a streaming frontend for DebConf17.</p>
  <p>I know of the following rooms:
    <ul>
      {% for room in streaming.rooms %}
      <li>{{ room }}: <a href='/redir/live/{{ room }}.m3u8'>Stream for {{ room }}</a></li>
      {% endfor %}
    </ul>
    If you click on the links your browser will download a useless playlist; You
    should right click to copy the link, then open that in your favorite video
    player. VLC, mpv and mplayer are all known to work!
